## DONE

* __Regenerate my baseline from scratch(hold-out validation)__
    1. W/features: shop_id, item_id, date_num_block.
    2. Lag ... Lagged item_cnt_month for month/shop/item
    3. Date ... Month
    4. Price ... Average and variance of price for month/shop/item

Note: Switching to google colab from kaggle notebook for more consistent performance. 

## Result:

* __Current baseline model: 0.986(public score)__
    * model: xgb
    * completed: 12/13/2020

## Next: 

1. Re-implement the "Future Sale 3" notebook
