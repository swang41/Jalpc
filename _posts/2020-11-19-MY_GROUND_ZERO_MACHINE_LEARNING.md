Challenges I have on my path of learning and applying machine learning from school and work are <\br>
1. clarify/reframe the problem
2. easily understand the data
3. quickly coming out/implementing/testing the new idea
4. not actively invovled in a machine learning community where people learn from each other.

I have considered taking a research route(phd) by which I can relearn some foundamental knowledge and working on a few advanced topics within acedemia enviroment. However, when I rethink about this crazy plan. It's probably not worthy for me. Yes, it definely will helps me with getting the dream job. However, I have to quit my fulltime job and be away from family for years. Not even to mention the amount of prework I need to finish in order to get into a credited program. My current goal is getting better in applying machine learning, and competing in kaggle makes perfct sense for me. it removes a lot of barriers and creates a 'safe' environment for people to learn/fail.<br\>
