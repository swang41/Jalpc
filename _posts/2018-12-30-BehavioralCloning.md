# **Behavioral Cloning**

---

**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use data provided by udacity and data after augmentated
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Use simulator to collect driving data of track two
* Re-train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track two without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network
* writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results
* EDA.ipynb exploration of steering angles
* track1.mp4 video for driving through track one
* track2.mp4 video fro driving through track two

#### 2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

Nvidia neural network is used. It consists of a convolution neural network with 5x5 and 3x3 filter  and depths between 24 and 64 (model.py lines 183-200)

The model includes ELU layers to introduce nonlinearity and better convergence due to implicit batch-norm (code lines 183-200), and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (code line 184).

#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting and time complexity (model.py lines 196) and l2 regulation in both convolutional and fully connected layers except last two fully connected layers(code lines 185-198).

The input image is resized to 64x64 in order to reduce the complexity of model, at the same it faster the training turnover.

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code lines 155-157). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used
* batch size: 64
* adam optimizer with learning rate 0.001, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 174).
* <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda" />  for l2: 0.001
* keep probability for dropout: 0.5
* samples per eporch: 20032

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. The data used are udacity data and one regular and one revese lap on track 2 from all three cameras. Beside those, data augmentation is heavily used. Images are randomly applied flipping, shearring and brightening.

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach


My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the Nvidia end-to-end neural network. I thought this model might be appropriate because it is not too complex for the problem.

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. However, I found validation loss is consistantly less than training loss which is quiet against the intuition. At the same, a model with less lower loss doesn't necessarily mean it drives better around the track.

At first I thought the model probably overfitting, I add a dropout layer after the flatten layer and l2 regulation to convoluntional layers and fully connected layers. It did show some improvement, but it still could not do well in cury road, especially the turn right after the bridge. It seems the data wasn't able to train the model to deal with cury road. Like most people did, I change my main task to getting more approriate data.

What's more, I use model checkpoint in keras to save model in every eporch since validation loss isn't a good indicator for a model goodness.

During the process of getting approriate data, I have tried to collect data by myself, which turned out it's an endless game. Most of them it's gabbage in and gabbage out. After a few weeks work, I decided to generate data with intensively using data augmentation and suppressed the number of training data which has abs(steering) less than 0.1 generate from the generator.

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track one without leaving the road, but it still could not finish the track two without leaving the road. It got confused when there are two road paralleling with each other, and could not recognized the blockage in track two. Despite my bad experience of collecting data by myself, I ended up with reluntantly collect two lap data for the track two after I attempted to augmentate the helpful data with shawdowing and vertical translating.

Here is a visualization of the architecture (note: visualizing the architecture is optional according to the project rubric)

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To get more approriate data I first use multiple cameras and add corresponding steering adjustment:

<img src="{{ site.img_path }}/SDC/multiple_cameras.png" alt="Multiple Cameras" class="img_center"/>

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would give more data point with bigger steering and symmetrize the distribution of steering angle. For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

<img src="{{ site.img_path }}/SDC/flip.png" alt="Flipped Image" class="img_center"/>


Then I randomly brighten the image thinking that color of track two is lighter than track one. Randomly brightness may help us with training more generalized model. here is an image that has then been randomly brightened:

<img src="{{ site.img_path }}/SDC/bright.png" alt="Brightened Image" class="img_center"/>

Then I randomly horizontally shear the image thinking that this would give more data with more variety of steering angle. here is an image that has then been randomly brightened:

<img src="{{ site.img_path }}/SDC/shear.png" alt="Shared Image" class="img_center"/>

Finally I split the udacity data and some extra data into training and validation data, and feed them into a generator function where random data augmentation will be applied and suppress the number of data with minor angle.

Then I trained the model with fit_generator and at eporch 14, I got a model which is able to complete both tracks without leaving the road.

### Next step:

I would like to try online learning approach for this problem, which may be another possible to solve this problem.
